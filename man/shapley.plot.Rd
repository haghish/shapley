\title{Plot weighted SHAP contributions}
\usage{
shapley.plot(
  shapley,
  plot = "bar",
  method = "shapratio",
  cutoff = 0.01,
  top_n_features = NULL,
  features = NULL,
  legendstyle = "continuous",
  scale_colour_gradient = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapley}{object of class 'shapley', as returned by the 'shapley' function}

\item{plot}{character, specifying the type of the plot, which can be either
'bar', 'waffle', or 'shap'. The default is 'bar'.}

\item{method}{character, specifying the method used for identifying the most
important features according to their weighted SHAP values.
The default selection method is "shapratio", a method that filters
for features where the proportion of their relative weighted SHAP
value exceeds the 'cutoff'. This approach calculates the relative
contribution of each feature's weighted SHAP value against the
aggregate of all features, with those surpassing the 'cutoff'
being selected as top feature.
Alternatively, the "mean" option can be specified, indicating
any feature with normalized weighted mean SHAP contribution above
the specified 'cutoff' should be selected. Another
alternative options is "lowerCI", which includes
features whose lower weighted confidence interval exceeds the
predefined 'cutoff' value (default is relative SHAP of 1\%).}

\item{cutoff}{numeric, specifying the cutoff for the method used for selecting
the top features.}

\item{top_n_features}{integer. if specified, the top n features with the
highest weighted SHAP values will be selected, overrullung
the 'cutoff' and 'method' arguments.}

\item{features}{character vector, specifying the feature to be plotted.}

\item{legendstyle}{character, specifying the style of the plot legend, which
can be either 'continuous' (default) or 'discrete'. the
continuous legend is only applicable to 'shap' plots and
other plots only use 'discrete' legend.}

\item{scale_colour_gradient}{character vector for specifying the color gradients
for the plot.}

\dontrun{
# load the required libraries for building the base-learners and the ensemble models
library(h2o)            #shapley supports h2o models
library(shapley)

# initiate the h2o server
h2o.init(ignore_config = TRUE, nthreads = 2, bind_to_localhost = FALSE, insecure = TRUE)

# upload data to h2o cloud
prostate_path <- system.file("extdata", "prostate.csv", package = "h2o")

### H2O provides 2 types of grid search for tuning the models, which are
### AutoML and Grid. Below, I demonstrate how weighted mean shapley values
### can be computed for both types.

set.seed(10)

### PREPARE AutoML Grid (takes a couple of minutes)
#######################################################
# run AutoML to tune various models (GBM) for 60 seconds
y <- "CAPSULE"
prostate[,y] <- as.factor(prostate[,y])  #convert to factor for classification
aml <- h2o.automl(y = y, training_frame = prostate, max_runtime_secs = 120,
                 include_algos=c("GBM"),

                 # this setting ensures the models are comparable for building a meta learner
                 seed = 2023, nfolds = 10,
                 keep_cross_validation_predictions = TRUE)

### call 'shapley' function to compute the weighted mean and weighted confidence intervals
### of SHAP values across all trained models.
### Note that the 'newdata' should be the testing dataset!
result <- shapley(models = aml, newdata = prostate, plot = TRUE)
